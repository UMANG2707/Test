# **Branching Strategy for CI/CD**

This repository follows a structured branching strategy to manage multiple clients, versions, and environments efficiently.

---

## **Branching Structure**


Each **Client (C1, C2, C3, ...)** has a dedicated branch.  
Within each client branch, multiple **Version (V1, V2, V3, ...)** branches exist to manage different software versions.  
Each version contains System modules **(F1, F2, F3)**, where each module has Feature directories (Register, Login, Logout).**environment-specific directories (PROD, TEST, UAT)** containing configuration files.

### Justification for This Structure

We are structuring branches based on versions and clients to ensure smooth updates and independent management for each client. According to best practices, all three environments (TEST, UAT, PROD) should be identical for a specific client to maintain consistency. Since the number of environments is finite, we create separate directories for each one.

Using environment variable files, we can make configurations dynamic, allowing different variables per environment. If a specific code change is required only for PROD, it can be handled using conditional checks.

Regarding branching, we maintain separate branches for each client and each version. Additionally, when a new client joins, they will always start with the latest available version to simplify onboarding and avoid maintaining outdated versions.

We are structuring branches as Client/Version (e.g., C1/V1, C1/V2, C2/V1) to keep each clientâ€™s versions separate and manageable.

## Question - 1 - How can you manage the CICD for each type of system for each client with a different version in each environment? 

#### ohhh, Since each client uses a different version for each environment, the current strategy would be difficult to manage. So, Iâ€™ll restructure it to make it more efficient.

### Managing CI/CD for Each System, Client, and Version
Since each client can use different versions across environments, managing everything in a single repository becomes complex. To handle this efficiently, we use two repositories with a sequential pipeline approach:

Test-Repo (Application Code & Versioning)

Contains the actual application code for different systems (F1, F2, F3) and features (Register, Login, Logout).
Uses version-based branches (V1, V2, V3...VN) to maintain different versions.
CI pipeline builds Docker images for each system or feature and pushes them to a container registry with proper version tags.
Test-Configuration (Client-Specific Deployments)

Manages client-specific configurations.
Each client (C1, C2, C3...) has a dedicated directory.
Inside each client directory, environment-specific subdirectories (TEST, UAT, PROD) are maintained.
These environments pull the required Docker images from Test-Repo and deploy the appropriate version based on client requirements.

Yes, this structure makes it easy to manage deployments for each client, environment, and module. By maintaining separate repositories for the application code and configurations:

- **Application-Repo**: Builds and pushes versioned Docker images for each module.

- **Configuration-Repo**: Defines client-specific environments and selects the appropriate image versions for deployment.

This approach ensures flexibility, easy version control, and seamless updatesâ€”just by changing the image version in the deployment files.
