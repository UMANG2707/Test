# **Branching Strategy for CI/CD**

This repository follows a structured branching strategy to manage multiple clients, versions, and environments efficiently.

## **Branching Structure & Repos**

## Question - 1 - How can you manage the CICD for each type of system for each client with a different version in each environment? 

#### ohhh, Since each client uses a different version for each environment, the current strategy would be difficult to manage. So, I’ll restructure it to make it more efficient.

### Managing CI/CD for Each System, Client, and Version
Since each client can use different versions across environments, managing everything in a single repository becomes complex. To handle this efficiently, we use two repositories with a sequential pipeline approach:

Test-Repo (Application Code & Versioning)

Contains the actual application code for different systems (F1, F2, F3) and features (Register, Login, Logout).
Uses version-based branches (V1, V2, V3...VN) to maintain different versions.
CI pipeline builds Docker images for each system or feature and pushes them to a container registry with proper version tags.
Test-Configuration (Client-Specific Deployments)

Manages client-specific configurations.
Each client (C1, C2, C3...) has a dedicated directory.
Inside each client directory, environment-specific subdirectories (TEST, UAT, PROD) are maintained.
These environments pull the required Docker images from Test-Repo and deploy the appropriate version based on client requirements.

Yes, this structure makes it easy to manage deployments for each client, environment, and module. By maintaining separate repositories for the application code and configurations:

- **Application-Repo**: Builds and pushes versioned Docker images for each module.

- **Configuration-Repo**: Defines client-specific environments and selects the appropriate image versions for deployment.

This approach ensures flexibility, easy version control, and seamless updates—just by changing the image version in the deployment files.
